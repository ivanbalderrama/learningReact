# learningReact
This project is a tutorial provided by Scrimba to learn the basics of React. In this project I practiced making components.

#Challenges
The only challenge I had when learning react was trying to get the local environment set up. Had issues on my Windows computer. My primary focus is not to trouble shoot what occurred that error at this time but rather learning the language. 
To resolve and complete my project I cloned this project to my Macbook and continued to finish the project.
